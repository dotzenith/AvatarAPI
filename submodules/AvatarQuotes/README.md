### ❖ Contributing

AvatarQuotes is a 1-man effort as of now. As a consequence of my own hubris, there may be many errors and non-ideal design choices present throughout the repo.

- With the above in mind, PRs for corrections and additions are welcomed and encouraged. 

- The transcripts found on the [Avatar Wiki](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Wiki) are considered the only source of truth. As such, if you're correcting or adding a quote, please link the appropriate page in the PR description.

- Please run the `tests/helpers.py` script to make sure a new `Quotes.csv` file is generated from the changes you made.
  - The script uses pandas, which can be installed by running the following: `pip3 install pandas`

- There are no plans on adding Korra just yet, but if there's enough interest, I'd be more than happy to open a discussion and we can discuss how to proceed with that.

### ❖ Testing

- AvatarQuotes uses python tests (pytest) for data validation. A PR must pass all test cases before it can be merged into the main branch.

### ❖ About AvatarQuotes

AvatarQuotes exists simply because I like Avatar: The Last Airbender a lot and I wanted a sensible way to store all the words of wisdom and fun that show has to offer. 

Special thanks to the [Avatar Wiki](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Wiki) for the transcripts and info on various characters.
