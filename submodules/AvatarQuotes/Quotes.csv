Quote|Character|Nation|Bending|Episode|Book
You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it?|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
Food eats people! Also, Momo could talk. You said some very unkind things.|Sokka|Water|None|The Storm|Water
Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?|Merchant woman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?|Sokka|Water|None|The Storm|Water
You could get a job, smart guy.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.|Fisherman's wife|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Well, it's your joints against my brain.|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'.|Fisherman's wife|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?|Jee|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!|Fisherman's wife|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Boy with tattoos? Airbender tattoos. Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle. You're the Avatar, ain't ya?|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world!|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering.|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives.|Tashi|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.|Pasang|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
I'm sick of taking his orders! I'm tired of chasing his Avatar! I mean, who does Zuko think he is?|Jee|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Try to understand. My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.|Gyatso|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. Zuko would have to duel his own father.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.|Gyatso|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.|Pasang|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?|Gyatso|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Please, Father. I only had the Fire Nation's best interest at heart. I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
You will fight for your honor.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
I meant you no disrespect. I am your loyal son.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
You will learn respect, and suffering will be your teacher.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
I'm too young to die!|Sokka|Water|None|The Storm|Water
I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Master|Water
I have an idea! Why don't we all get on your back and you could fly us to the North Pole?!|Aang|Air|Air|The Waterbending Master|Water
I'd love to. Climb on everyone, Sokka's ready for take off.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Master|Water
Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Four seasons ... four loves ... Four seasons ... for love|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Master|Water
May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times!|Yue|Water|Water|The Waterbending Master|Water
You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Master|Water
My apologies, Prince Sokka.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Master|Water
I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Master|Water
For the last time, I'm not playing the tsungi horn!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Master|Water
In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.|Pakku|Water|Water|The Waterbending Master|Water
What do you mean you won't teach me? I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no!|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Master|Water
It's Princess Yue. I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Master|Water
Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.|Aang|Air|Air|The Waterbending Master|Water
No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Master|Water
I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Master|Water
But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Master|Water
I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Master|Water
It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.|Aang|Air|All|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Calm down, it's going to be okay. If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes.|Aang|Air|All|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Mud and bugs!|Aang|Air|All|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.|Aang|Air|All|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here! Don't be shy, come on by!|Oh|Earth|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur.|Pirate captain|Earth|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
We prefer to think of ourselves as 'high risk traders.'|Oh|Earth|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Well, well. Look who's come to their senses. Told you the haggling would pay off.|Aang|Air|All|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
My cabbages! This place is worse than Omashu!|Cabbage merchant|Earth|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.|Aang|Air|All|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender!|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending!|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Quite the contrary. I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Will you please shut your air hole? Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes!|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
What about Momo? He's the real victim here.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
I'll save you from the pirates.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
I need to capture him to restore something I've lost, my honor.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap? Ah!|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment?|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Shut your mouth, you Water Tribe peasant!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense. Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life.|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Could you two quit congratulating each other and help me out?|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Have you lost your mind? This is no time for flute practice!|Sokka|Water|None|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Aang, I still owe you an apology. You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Stealing is wrong. Unless it's from pirates.|Katara|Water|Water|The Waterbending Scroll|Water
Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on?|Katara|Water|Water|The Great Divide|Water
You're infuriating!|Katara|Water|Water|The Great Divide|Water
Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry.|Sokka|Water|None|The Great Divide|Water
Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs|Sokka|Water|None|The Great Divide|Water
Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the Tents!|Katara|Water|Water|The Great Divide|Water
Harsh words won't solve problems, action will.|Aang|Air|All|The Great Divide|Water
You see that? Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar.|Aang|Air|All|The Great Divide|Water
You wouldn't be so calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee! My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se.|Gan Jin tribesman|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years.|Gan Jin tribesman|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
Sick people get priority over old people.|Zhang leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.|Gan Jin leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, you wouldn't live to be so old.|Zhang leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves!|Gan Jin leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job.|Katara|Water|Water|The Great Divide|Water
Oh, you babies can go a day without food? Would you rather be hungry, or dead?|Canyon guide|Earth|Earth|The Great Divide|Water
He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices.|Canyon guide|Earth|Earth|The Great Divide|Water
No bendng ... we need to get out of this canyon ... I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!|Canyon guide|Earth|Earth|The Great Divide|Water
Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts!|Aang|Air|All|The Great Divide|Water
Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails|Gan Jin leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
Oh sorry, I forgot that to the Gan Jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!|Zhang leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers.|Katara|Water|Water|The Great Divide|Water
They're coming back for me! They've had a taste and they're coming back for me!|Canyon guide|Earth|Earth|The Great Divide|Water
I only took their side 'cause they fed me.|Sokka|Water|None|The Great Divide|Water
I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.|Zhang leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
I never knew you Zhangs were so reliable in a pinch.|Gan Jin leader|Earth|None|The Great Divide|Water
Now where is that custard tart? I'm starving!|Aang|Air|All|The Great Divide|Water
See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most.|Hakoda|Water|None|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
Perfume? Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much.|Sokka|Water|None|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
Yeah, nothing's cozier than dead animal skins.|Aang|Air|All|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?|Sokka|Water|None|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
Your dad wore the octopus, but I did the spooky voice.|Bato|Water|None|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
He means no offense! I'm certain you bathe regularly!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
Ice dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery, and trust.|Bato|Water|None|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?|Sokka|Water|None|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family, too. And right now, you need us more.|Sokka|Water|None|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you ...|Aang|Air|All|Bato of the Water Tribe|Water
What? You wanna walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired-up with their ... you know, fire?|Sokka|Water|None|The Deserter|Water
Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.|Sokka|Water|None|The Deserter|Water
I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, Jeong Jeong the Deserter.|Chey|Fire|None|The Deserter|Water
He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that.|Chey|Fire|None|The Deserter|Water
If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control! He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself. But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive! It breathes, it grows. Without the bender, a rock will not throw itself! But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it! That is its destiny!|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire. Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
Fire is a horrible burden to bear. Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it.|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.|Jeong Jeong|Fire|Fire|The Deserter|Water
Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up!|Aang|Air|All|The Deserter|Water
Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!|Aang|Air|All|The Deserter|Water
Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble. Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!|Sokka|Water|None|The Deserter|Water
Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.|Sokka|Water|None|The Deserter|Water
The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu! I used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi.|Aang|Air|All|The King of Omashu|Water
They have buildings here that don't melt!|Sokka|Water|None|The King of Omashu|Water
So what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?|Aang|Air|All|The King of Omashu|Water
Technically, Aang is 112 years old.|Katara|Water|Water|The King of Omashu|Water
Now let's get to skippin', young whipper-snappers. The big city awaits!|Aang|Air|All|The King of Omashu|Water
No! My cabbages!|Cabbage merchant|Earth|None|The King of Omashu|Water
Name's Bonzu Pippinpaddleopsicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.|Aang|Air|All|The King of Omashu|Water
This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.|Aang|Air|All|The King of Omashu|Water
My cabbages! You're gonna pay for this!|Cabbage merchant|Earth|All|The King of Omashu|Water
Two cabbages please.|Aang|Air|Air|The King of Omashu|Water
Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!|Cabbage merchant|Earth|All|The King of Omashu|Water
Throw them ... a feast!|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts, so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
I'm from ... Kangaroo Island!|Aang|Air|Air|The King of Omashu|Water
Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hopping!|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Appa's a ten-ton flying bison; I think he could figure something out.|Aang|Air|All|The King of Omashu|Water
The real challenges are much more, uh, challenging.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Those delightful rings are made of pure jennamite, also known as creeping crystal. It's a crystal that grows remarkably fast. By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it. Terrible thing, really. I can stop it, but only if you cooperate.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry. Ooh, there it is! Would you mind fetching it for me?|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great!|Katara|Water|Water|The King of Omashu|Water
You thought I was a frail old man, but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here. Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Bumi, you're a mad genius.|Aang|Air|All|The King of Omashu|Water
It's pretty fun messing with people.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
The world has changed in the hundred years that you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|The King of Omashu|Water
Uh uh. No flying this time.|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Think about it: Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa, he's just too noticeable.|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head! It's kinda hard to miss him!|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.|Aang|Air|All|Jet|Water
I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior, so I'm the leader!|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.|Katara|Water|Water|Jet|Water
I've kissed a girl, you just haven't met her.|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's instincts.|Katara|Water|Water|Jet|Water
If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters, Sneers, Longshot, Smellerbee, The Duke, and Pipsqueak.|Jet|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Ha, ha, Pipsqueak, that's a funny name.|Aang|Air|All|Jet|Water
I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble.|Jet|Earth|None|Jet|Water
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town.|Jet|Earth|None|Jet|Water
The Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.|Jet|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.|Katara|Water|Water|Jet|Water
Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!|Jet|Earth|None|Jet|Water
How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother, we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.|Jet|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me, you're sick and I trusted you!|Katara|Water|Water|Jet|Water
No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship! Now we could all be in danger!|Kanna|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
The foreigner(aang) is banished from our village.|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun.|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun!|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Fine! Then I'm banished, too! Come on Aang, let's go.|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar Returns|Water
Aang, don't go! I'll miss you!|Southern Water Tribe girl|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar Returns|Water
All right, ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
No potty breaks!|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Yeah, I liked her(katara) too.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar Returns|Water
I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training, meditating. You're just a child!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Avatar Returns|Water
Well, you're just a teenager.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar Returns|Water
Head a course for the Fire Nation. I'm going home.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Avatar Returns|Water
We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
It's been so long since I've had hope, but you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.|Kanna|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance. You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.|Kanna|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Get in, we're going to save your boyfriend|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
You just looove taking me out of my comfort zone, don't you?|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before. I bet I could take you both with my hands tied behind my back.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar Returns|Water
Up. Ascend. Elevate.|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar Returns|Water
According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar Returns|Water
I'm just a guy, with a boomerang.|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar Returns|Water
I laugh at gravity all the time.|Aang|Air|All|The Northern Air Temple|Water
Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo.|Aang|Air|All|The Northern Air Temple|Water
We better find some solid ground, before it finds us.|Sokka|Water|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!|Aang|Air|All|The Northern Air Temple|Water
Well, people around here are starting to stink.|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe knife sharpener. Only took me three tries to get it right.|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my eyebrows would never grow back.|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
Aaaaah! I can't believe I'm flying!|Katara|Water|Water|The Northern Air Temple|Water
Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!|Aang|Air|All|The Northern Air Temple|Water
a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug!|Katara|Water|Water|The Northern Air Temple|Water
You smell rotten eggs! Then, you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from.|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka. This boy's a genius!|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
Stink! Never underestimate the power of stink!|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
Aang you were right about air power. As long as we've got the skies, we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.|Sokka|Water|None|The Northern Air Temple|Water
I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.|Katara|Water|Water|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Leave it to a girl to screw things up!|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!|Katara|Water|Water|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Will you go penguin sledding with me?|Aang|Air|All|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
You just sneezed ... and flew ten feet in the air!|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ... I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy snot monster!|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Appa, yip-yip!|Aang|Air|All|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending.|Aang|Air|All|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Ya know, last time I checked, humans can't fly!|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time all day long.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Power in firebending comes from the breath, not the muscles. The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
No, you are impatient.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
but first, I must finish my roast duck.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe, and that means no potty breaks!|Sokka|Water|None|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.|Katara|Water|Water|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear.|Aang|Air|All|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
The last airbender! Quite agile for his old age.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boy in the Iceberg|Water
We've got a few options. First; round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might just be rocks.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Shouldn't we run away from huge booms? Not toward them?|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Which means no nuts for dinner!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Yeah, I hate 'em too.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Great hat! I'll trade you some nuts for it.|Aang|Air|All|Imprisoned|Water
They're crazy, Mom! I mean, look at how they're dressed.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Fire Nation! Act natural!|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
They're thugs. They steal from us. And everyone here's too much of a coward to do anything about it.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Yeah. Problem is ... the only way I can feel close to my father now is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and ta-da! Fake earthbending.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Get out of my way, pipsqueak!|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
That lemur! He's earthbending!|Guard|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
Momo, you have some big ears!|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
You've got guts, Katara. I'll give you that.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Katara, I admire your courage. And I envy your youth. But people's lives are at stake here. The warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless.|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your courage they should truly fear!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up on these people.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Well, sir, it looked like a flying bison.|Captain|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
It was a giant flying buffalo, sir. With an empty saddle.|Guard|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
Then wake up someone I haven't thrown overboard and search the rig! There's something going on here and I don't like it.|Warden|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
wish I knew how to make a hurricane!|Aang|Air|All|Imprisoned|Water
Foolish girl. You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces. Their spirits were broken a long time ago.|Warden|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
No, please! I can't swim!|Warden|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
Don't worry. I hear cowards float.|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
You have no idea where you're going, do you?|Sokka|Water|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It's just the natural order of things.|Sokka|Water|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Where we're going, you won't need any pants.|Aang|Air|All|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it.|Aang|Air|All|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.|Sokka|Water|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
A bunch of girls, huh? The Unagi's gonna eat well tonight.|Suki|Earth|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.|Katara|Water|Water|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.|Katara|Water|Water|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
I'm not scared of any girls.|Sokka|Water|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.|Aang|Air|All|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls.|Sokka|Water|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Sorry ladies, didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.|Sokka|Water|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.|Sokka|Water|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.|Suki|Earth|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun|Katara|Water|Water|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
The silk threads symbolize the brave blood that flows through our veins. The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart.|Suki|Earth|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
It's not about strength. Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them|Suki|Earth|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
I am a warrior. But I'm a girl, too.|Suki|Earth|None|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed.|Katara|Water|Water|The Warriors of Kyoshi|Water
Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business.|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
You mean, all of you or just your neck? I mean, because they both look great!|Aang|Air|All|The Fortuneteller|Water
Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love!|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. A sweet, little guy! Just like Momo|Katara|Water|Water|The Fortuneteller|Water
Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!|Aang|Air|All|The Fortuneteller|Water
Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.|Katara|Water|Water|The Fortuneteller|Water
Oh, come on. Fortune telling is nonsense!|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
You can't really tell the future!|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?|Meng|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Don't be modest! They're huge!|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?|Katara|Water|Water|The Fortuneteller|Water
It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
That's so romantic! I wonder if my true love will give me a rare flower.|Meng|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have.|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Your palms are so smooth. Do you use moisturizer?|Wu|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
I feel a great romance for you. The man you are going to marry.|Wu|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted|Wu|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
You will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. A battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!|Wu|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.|Katara|Water|Water|The Fortuneteller|Water
That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful!|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal.|Aang|Air|All|The Fortuneteller|Water
And then you will have your third great-grandchild before quietly passing away in your sleep.|Wu|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
I don't care what Aunt Wu told you! You have to take a bath sometime!|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.|Sokka|Water|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love.|Aang|Air|All|The Fortuneteller|Water
That Water Tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.|Meng|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Just as you reshaped those clouds, you have the power to shape your own destiny.|Wu|Earth|None|The Fortuneteller|Water
Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Southern Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world!|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Air Temple|Water

Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food.|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Air Temple|Water
We're home, buddy! We're home|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Air Temple|Water
If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Air Temple|Water
I'm just a simple guy, with simple needs.|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Air Temple|Water
Your aim has improved greatly, my young pupil.|Gyatso|Air|Air|The Southern Air Temple|Water
The key, Sokka, is airbending.|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Air Temple|Water
Statues? That's it? Where's the meat?|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Air Temple|Water
You just couldn't get any weirder.|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Air Temple|Water
I want to eat you!|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Air Temple|Water
Once I deliver the Avatar to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Air Temple|Water
If your father really wanted you home, he would have let you return by now, Avatar or no Avatar. But in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Southern Air Temple|Water
An Agni Kai. At sunset.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Air Temple|Water
Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay?|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Air Temple|Water
Next time you get in my way, I promise, I won't hold back.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Air Temple|Water
Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Southern Air Temple|Water
Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family. Sokka and I! We're your family now!|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Air Temple|Water

Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick!|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
What? I'm not allowed to be angry?|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.|Katara|Water|Water|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible! But, those markings ... are you the Avatar, child?|Kay-fon|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
So, the rumors of your return are true! It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.|Senlin Village leader|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope! For the last few days at sunset, a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is Hei Bai, the black and white spirit.|Kay-fon|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Hei Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here, there's no telling what will happen.|Senlin Village leader|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the Spirit World than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits.|Kay-fon|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Yeah. We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West. The once-great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.|Earthbender captain|Earth|Earth|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
The Avatar's methods are ... unusual.|Senlin Village leader|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.|Earthbender captain|Earth|Earth|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. And I'm still tired.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
I'm in the Spirit World!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Now would you please put on some clothes?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water

As we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits. Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us!|Arnook|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quiet dread.|Arnook|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. I'm going to make a difference this time.|Aang|Air|All|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.|Aang|Air|All|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
I'm just one kid.|Aang|Air|All|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well, ever since I lost my son ... I think of you as my own.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!|Sokka|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves.|Yue|Water|Water|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon. Our life comes from the spirit of the ocean. They work together to keep balance.|Yue|Water|Water|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them!|Katara|Water|Water|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine.|Sokka|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.|Katara|Water|Water|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
You rise with the moon ... I rise with the sun.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 1|Water
The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits. They crossed over the Spirit World to the mortal world very near the beginning.|Roku|Fire|All|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
The spirit's name is Koh, but he is very dangerous. They call him the Face Stealer. When you speak with him, you must be very careful to show no emotion at all. Not the slightest expression, or he will steal your face.|Roku|Fire|All|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Admiral Choi! Prepare to meet your fate!|Hahn|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
I knew then that these spirits could be found and killed. And that it was my destiny to do so.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
The Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world. And now they will face the consequences.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up|Sokka|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection.|Koh|None|None|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other, push and pull, life and death, good and evil, yin and yang.|Koh|None|None|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Here for a rematch?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Hey, this is some quality rope!|Sokka|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.|Sokka|Water|None|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
I owe the Moon Spirit my life.|Yue|Water|Water|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
The Fire Nation will, for generations, tell stories about the great Zhao, who darkened the moon. They will call me, Zhao the Conqueror, Zhao the Moon Slayer, Zhao the Invincible!|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
It's my destiny, to destroy the moon and the Water Tribe.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world.|Aang|Air|All|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Goodbye, Sokka. I'll always be with you.|Yue|Water|Water|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Iroh is a traitor, and your brother Zuko is a failure. I have a task for you.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|The Siege of the North, Part 2|Water
Colonel Shinu, please reconsider ... Their precision is legendary. The Yuyan can pin a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away ... without killing it.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Blue Spirit|Water
It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request ... is now an order.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Blue Spirit|Water
You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.|Sokka|Water|None|The Blue Spirit|Water
That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender!|Aang|Air|All|The Blue Spirit|Water
Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water.|Katara|Water|Water|The Blue Spirit|Water
So this is the great Avatar. Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Blue Spirit|Water
I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now|Aang|Air|All|The Blue Spirit|Water
Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left? Do you miss your people? Don't worry, you won't be killed like they were.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Blue Spirit|Water
See, if you die you will just be reborn and the Fire Nation would have to start searching all over again. So I'll keep you alive, but just barely.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Blue Spirit|Water
This is the year Sozin's Comet returns to grant us its power! This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba Sing Se and burns the city to the ground!|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Blue Spirit|Water
What? No! Don't leave, frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen!|Aang|Air|All|The Blue Spirit|Water
My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out!|Aang|Air|All|The Blue Spirit|Water
Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!|Aang|Air|All|The Blue Spirit|Water
Who's this 'Aang' kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?|Sokka|Water|None|The Blue Spirit|Water
Hold your fire! The Avatar must be captured alive!|Zhao|Fire|Fire|The Blue Spirit|Water
If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?|Aang|Air|All|The Blue Spirit|Water
What? Like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
So you were showing me the octopus form?|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Don't fall in love with the traveling girl. She'll leave you broke and brokenhearted.|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
You guys are nomads? That's great! I'm a nomad!|Aang|Air|All|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Oh. Nice underwear ...|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
I didn't find anything to eat! I can't live like this! I wasn't meant to be a fugitive.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking. That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Hmm ... delectable tea? Or deadly poison?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows.|Sokka|Water|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
You got to focus less on the 'where' and more on the 'going'.|Lily|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together!|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Secret love cave, let's go.|Sokka|Water|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade. That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
But where are we going to go? We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
All you need to do is trust in love ... according to the curse|Lily|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise, you'll be trapped in them forever.|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!|Sokka|Water|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Everyone into the hole!|Sokka|Water|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Names? Of course we have names. I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ... Mushi?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away. That was the last time I saw my father.|Song|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
It's a giant flying thing with teeth!|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Oh, don't let the cave-in get you down! Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown! When the tunnels are darkest, that's when you need a clown, hey! Don't let the cave-in get you down, Sokka!|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... but their love was strong and they found a way.|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
The two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles; they became the first earthbenders.|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly. Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth. But, one day, the man didn't come he'd died in the war between the two villages. Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all .. but, instead, she declared the war over. Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Love is brightest in the dark.|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We're thinking of ideas? Because I've had an idea for, like, an hour now.|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Well, what if we ... kissed?|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that?|Katara|Water|Water|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Yeah. I definitely wouldn't want to kiss you!|Aang|Air|All|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment|Aang|Air|All|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart ...|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned.|Song|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
The big, bad badgermoles who earthbend the tunnels, hate the wolfbats, but love the sounds!|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way.|Aang|Air|All|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.|Sokka|Water|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you: I think that kid might be the Avatar!|Chong|Earth|None|The Cave of Two Lovers|Earth
They will if you ask nicely. Spare change for a hungry old man?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Swamp|Earth
The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Swamp|Earth
It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Swamp|Earth
They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Swamp|Earth
I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me.|Aang|Air|All|The Swamp|Earth
No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ... alive.|Katara|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine. Right, swamp? 'No problem, Sokka!'|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines!|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
No, that's what they call a 'lemoo'. Saw one at a traveling show once. Real smart they say.|Tho|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
You think everything tastes like possum chicken.|Tho|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
Now, what would a lemoo need a shirt fer?|Tho|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it, like this fella with his big knife.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
Oh the swamp is a mystical place all right. It's sacred. I reached enlightenment right here under the banyan-grove tree.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
See this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles. Branches spread and sink, take root, and spread some more. One big, living organism. Just like the entire world.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
You think you're any different from me or your friends or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together. You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots and we are all branches of the same tree.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
Set my lines by the river bed! Caught ten fish and I killed 'em dead! Cut 'em and gut 'em and I tossed the heads in the water to keep them catgators fed.|Tho|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
You know, scared some folks, swung some vines, the usual.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
Tastes just like arctic hen.|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
Oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food.|Due|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here.|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
What are you doing in my mouth?|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
Oh, I see, so there's time to get your scrolls [Turning toward Aang.] and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang?|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
I feel like I've lost part of my identity. Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... hair loopies.|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
I used to be boomerang guy ...|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated.|Aang|Air|All|Avatar Day|Earth
That party pooper's my friend!|Aang|Air|All|Avatar Day|Earth
I find that hard to swallow, considering what you did to us in your past life! It was Avatar Kyoshi; she murdered our glorious leader, Chin the Great.|Tong|Earth|None|Avatar Day|Earth
Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky.|Katara|Water|Water|Avatar Day|Earth
Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots! See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks.|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
It was at sunset, 370 years ago today, that she emerged from the temple, and struck down Chin the Great. After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader.|Tong|Earth|None|Avatar Day|Earth
Simple. I say what happened then you say what happened, and then I decide who's right. That's why we call it justice. Because it's 'just us.'|Tong|Earth|None|Avatar Day|Earth
Everyone loved Chin the Great because he was so great. Then the Avatar showed up and killed him, and that's how it happened.|Tong|Earth|None|Avatar Day|Earth
Oh, yeah. You see ... I have very large feet. Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue. But ... I was in a painting at sunset. So, there you have it, I'm not guilty.|Aang|Air|All|Avatar Day|Earth
To be honest with you the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Avatar Day|Earth
I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Avatar Day|Earth
There's no honor for me without the Avatar.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Avatar Day|Earth
No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Avatar Day|Earth
In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Avatar Day|Earth
I killed Chin the Conqueror.|Kyoshi|Earth|All|Avatar Day|Earth
I need to find my own way.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Avatar Day|Earth
Community service! Please stop on community service!|Katara|Water|Water|Avatar Day|Earth
Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.|Aang|Air|All|Avatar Day|Earth
Boomerang! You do always come back!|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
That's our new festival food! Un-fried dough. May we eat it and be reminded of how on this day the Avatar was not boiled in oil.|Tong|Earth|None|Avatar Day|Earth
This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.|Sokka|Water|None|Avatar Day|Earth
I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off!|Aang|Air|All|The Library|Earth
Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so.|Sokka|Water|None|The Library|Earth
I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy.|Sokka|Water|None|The Library|Earth
Now tell me- what was the primary agricultural product of your people?|Zei|Earth|None|The Library|Earth
You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Library|Earth
Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to read, so that we might better ourselves.|Zei|Earth|None|The Library|Earth
I'd like to spend my vacation at the library!|Sokka|Water|None|The Library|Earth
You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.|Sokka|Water|None|The Library|Earth
I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert and almost died each time.|Zei|Earth|None|The Library|Earth
Tell me, sky bison, are you the last of your breed? Delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue. Oh, the stories this beast could tell.|Zei|Earth|None|The Library|Earth
There it is! That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Library|Earth
I've held books before. And I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Library|Earth
You should leave the way you came. Unless you want to become a stuffed head of anthropology.|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
I am Wan Shi Tong, 'He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things.' And you are obviously humans, which, by the way, are no longer permitted in my study.|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
Humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans. Like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago, looking to destroy his enemy. So ... who are you trying to destroy?|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being, you should at least put some effort into it.|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
You're not very bright, are you?|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
So ... you like ... flying?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Library|Earth
Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed?|Katara|Water|Water|The Library|Earth
That's so unfair! Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago.|Sokka|Water|None|The Library|Earth
Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl|Sokka|Water|None|The Library|Earth
Mortals are so predictable, and such terrible liars. You betrayed my trust. From the beginning, you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes.|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous.|Sokka|Water|None|The Library|Earth
You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified? Countless others before you have come here seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies.|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
Great Knowledge Spirit, I beg you, do not destroy your vast collection of priceless tomes.|Zei|Earth|None|The Library|Earth
Your waterbending won't do you much good here. I've studied Northern water style, Southern water style, even Foggy Swamp style|Wan Shi Tong|None|None|The Library|Earth
I'm not leaving. I can't. I've spent too long trying to find this place. There's not another collection of knowledge like this on earth. I could spend an eternity in here.|Zei|Earth|None|The Library|Earth
Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Deadly route. Great pick, Sokka!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... as a tourist!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Look around. We're not tourists, we're refugees. Ugh! I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt. I'm tired of living like this!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Ahhh! My cabbages!|Cabbage merchant|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
It is your pleasure. As you can see, I am blind and these three imbeciles are my valets.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.|Suki|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Suki!|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since.|Suki|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
No passports, no tickets!|Ticket lady|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order! You know what that means, no more civilization!|Ticket lady|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.|Suki|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
How can we abandon hope? It's all we have!|Ying|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it.|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Thanks for saving my life, Toph. Hey, no problem, Sokka.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
You know, it's okay to miss Appa. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all.|Katara|Water|Water|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.|Katara|Water|Water|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Maybe it's because I'm not a man ... I'm a girl!|Smellerbee|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I know, you're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks, Longshot.|Smellerbee|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of, but that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se: for a new beginning. A second chance.|jet|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Actually, I'm going to stay on my little island, where I can see!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Oh Sokka, you saved me!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Oh ... well ... you can go ahead and let me drown now.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something?|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing!|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were. You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs. Because no one else will.|Jet|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
It's so ... squishy looking.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Say hi to that big fuzzball for me.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I was in the Avatar State, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar State|Earth
Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
I want the Avatar, I want my honor, my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
You might have mixed feelings about attacking members of the Royal Family. I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
Do the tides command this ship?|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
Well then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you, and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
With the kind of power he possesses, power enough to destroy hundreds of battle ships in a matter of minutes, he could defeat the Fire Lord now!|Fong|Earth|Earth|The Avatar State|Earth
I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar State|Earth
Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord!|Sokka|Water|None|The Avatar State|Earth
If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up!|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar State|Earth
Look at these magnificent shells! I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
In my country, we exchange a pleasant hello before asking questions. Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
Father regrets your banishment. He wants you home.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar State|Earth
Every day, more and more people die. I'm already one hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar State|Earth
I have never known my brother to regret anything.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him! He cares about me!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
I care about you! And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
I think you are exactly what you seem! A lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man who's always been jealous of his brother!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
Family sticks together, right?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
Father blames Uncle for the loss of the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar! Why would he want you back home, except to lock you up where you can no longer embarrass him?|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Avatar State|Earth
The Avatar State is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar State|Earth
The glow is the combination of all your past lives, focusing their energy through your body.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar State|Earth
In the Avatar State, you are at your most powerful, but you are also at your most vulnerable.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar State|Earth
If you are killed in the Avatar State, the reincarnation cycle will be broken and the Avatar will cease to exist.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar State|Earth
It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. Things are looking up, Uncle.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited?|Kuei|Earth|None|The Guru|Earth
It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
Or we could send in Momo to do some damage!|Katara|Water|Water|The Guru|Earth
I was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
Mai finally gets to wear make-up that's not totally depressing?|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Destructive? Buoyant? And ... Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!|Sokka|Water|None|The Guru|Earth
The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the 'stink and sink.'|Hakoda|Water|None|The Guru|Earth
Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
Now let's make these people some tea!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles?|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this.|Mai|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm going to throw up.|Mai|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
You have indeed felt a great loss. But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Yes. We are all one people, but we live as if divided.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Uncle! I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
Wooo! Toph, you rule.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Guru|Earth
Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara?|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
So, Zuzu's in the city, too? I think it's time for a family reunion.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Guru|Earth
Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior.|Hakoda|Water|None|The Guru|Earth
You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your ... everywhere, actually.|Katara|Water|Water|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
You call it dirt, I call it a healthy coating of earth!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
The Fancy Lady Day Spa? Sounds like my kinda place.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Well, that wasn't so bad. I'm not usually into that stuff but I actually feel ... girly.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
One of the good things about being blind, is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearance. I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval. I know who I am.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
You're so strong, and confident, and self-assured. And I know it doesn't matter, but ... You're really pretty.|Katara|Water|Water|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
I'd return the compliment, but I've no idea how you look like. Thank you, Katara.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and seek to restore honor.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
With a poor stance, you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Oh, that's a rabaroo. I wish I could get her a big open prairie like she likes.  I'd let her hop away to happiness.|Kenji|Earth|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
My cabba- Oh, forget it.|Cabbage merchant|Earth|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Excellent job, Avatar. You should think about working with animals for a living.|Kenji|Earth|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just ... wound up ... here.|Sokka|Water|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Five, seven, then five, syllables mark a haiku. Remarkable oaf.|Macmu-Ling|Earth|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe. I am not an oaf.|Sokka|Water|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Tittering monkey, in the spring he climbs treetops, and thinks himself tall.|Macmu-Ling|Earth|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard.|Sokka|Water|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Whole seasons are spent, mastering the form, the style, none calls it easy.|Macmu-Ling|Earth|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
I calls it easy. Like I paddle my canoe, I'll paddle yours too!|Sokka|Water|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
There's nuts and there's fruits. In fall the clinging plum drops, always to be squashed.|Macmu-Ling|Earth|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
Squish, squash, sling that slang. I'm always right back at ya, like my ... boomerang!|Sokka|Water|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
That's right, I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an 'okka', young ladies, I rocked ya!|Sokka|Water|None|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
You're right, Zuko. I've seen that girl in here quite a lot. Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
It took my uncle ten minutes to do my hair.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
You have ... quite an appetite for a girl.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
I've brought you something. It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Tales of Ba Sing Se|Earth
My own tea shop? This is a dream come true!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Lake Laogai|Earth
Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off!|Aang|Air|All|Lake Laogai|Earth
Oh, I simply took a short vacation to Lake Laogai, out in the country. It was quite relaxing.|Joo Dee|Earth|None|Lake Laogai|Earth
We can't wait around to get permission for everything.|Sokka|Water|None|Lake Laogai|Earth
That might come back to bite us in the blubber.|Sokka|Water|None|Lake Laogai|Earth
If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison, it could upset the delicate balance we've worked so hard to achieve in this city. It could even cost us control of the Earth King.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|Lake Laogai|Earth
So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Lake Laogai|Earth
There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Lake Laogai|Earth
I can feel his breathing and heartbeat. When people lie, there's a physical reaction. He's telling the truth.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Lake Laogai|Earth
Maybe Katara should kiss him. That should bring something back!|Sokka|Water|None|Lake Laogai|Earth
What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Lake Laogai|Earth
And then what!? You never think these things through! This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had nowhere to go!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Lake Laogai|Earth
Is it your own destiny, or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Lake Laogai|Earth
I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you, and what do you want?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Lake Laogai|Earth
Goooood morning, earthbending student!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara.|Katara|Water|Water|Bitter Work|Earth
Sorry, Snoozles, we'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Oh, maybe I could learn to make a whirlpool out of land!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
You must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Fire is the element of power. he people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay?|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal?|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
f you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Earthbend, Twinkle Toes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast. And even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got stuff.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!|Aang|Air|All|Bitter Work|Earth
You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back! Come on, strike me! You've never held back before!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.|Katara|Water|Water|The Earth King|Earth
I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se. And I can't even see!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Earth King|Earth
I don't trust the new positive Sokka. Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Earth King|Earth
Surface-to-air rocks! More incoming!|Sokka|Water|None|The Earth King|Earth
How should I know? I'm still voting we leave Ba Sing Se.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Earth King|Earth
You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to trust you?|Kuei|Earth|None|The Earth King|Earth
See? We're friends, Your Earthiness.|Aang|Air|All|The Earth King|Earth
That happens to be a large birth mark. Thanks for showing everyone.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|The Earth King|Earth
So this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this ... public.|Kuei|Earth|None|The Earth King|Earth
Dai Li! Arrest Long Feng! I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.|Kuei|Earth|None|The Earth King|Earth
Looks like Long Feng is long gone! Ha! Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one.|Sokka|Water|None|The Earth King|Earth
All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis was merely a city of fools. And that makes me the king fool.|Kuei|Earth|None|The Earth King|Earth
You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Earth King|Earth
Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Earth King|Earth
You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Earth King|Earth
Aahh! Great. That's enough. Okay, we love each other. Seriously.|Sokka|Water|None|The Earth King|Earth
Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever.|Sokka|Water|None|The Earth King|Earth
But just to be on the safe side ... Mai and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out!|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Drill|Earth
I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded.|General Sung|Earth|Earth|The Drill|Earth
Nevertheless, that is why the city is named Ba Sing Se. It's the 'impenetrable city'. They don't call it Na Sing Se. That means 'penetrable city.'|General Sung|Earth|Earth|The Drill|Earth
So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure.|Sokka|Water|None|The Drill|Earth
But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom. Your beauty is intoxicating.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Drill|Earth
You're pretty easy on the eyes yourself, handsome. Raorr! Welcome to Ba Sing Se|Ticket lady|Earth|None|The Drill|Earth
Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside.|Katara|Water|Water|The Drill|Earth
Hey, look at that dust cloud. It's so ... poofy. Poof.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Drill|Earth
It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing!|Sokka|Water|None|The Drill|Earth
No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it down out here.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Drill|Earth
Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Drill|Earth
I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ... it's just so sad!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Drill|Earth
What's this 'we' stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.|Katara|Water|Water|The Drill|Earth
Look, I'm the plan guy. You two are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys. Together, we're Team Avatar!|Sokka|Water|None|The Drill|Earth
She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me. I am not going in that wall sludge juice.|Mai|Fire|None|The Drill|Earth
Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak?|Katara|Water|Water|The Drill|Earth
Soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there!|General Sung|Earth|Earth|The Drill|Earth
You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day! You're like a chattering hog-monkey!|Katara|Water|Water|The Drill|Earth
What I'd give to be a metalbender.|Aang|Air|All|The Drill|Earth
Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on.|Katara|Water|Water|The Drill|Earth
How about ... the Boomeraang Squad! See it's good because it's got 'Aang' in it. Boomeraang.|Sokka|Water|None|The Drill|Earth
The Aang Gang?|Sokka|Water|None|The Drill|Earth
The Fearsome Foursome?|Sokka|Water|None|The Drill|Earth
Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!|Sokka|Water|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
You been hitting the cactus juice again?|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.|Sokka|Water|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
It's just a bunch of walls and rules. You wait, you'll get sick of it in a couple of days.|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Hello, my name is Joo Dee! I have been given the great honor of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se. And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph! Welcome to our wonderful city. Shall we get started?|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here.|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
This city is a prison. I don't want to make a life here.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Blech! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se. They are the guardians of all our traditions!|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
The Earth King is very busy running the finest city in the world!|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Shh, listen, you can't mention the War here. And whatever you do, stay away from the Dai Li.|Pong|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
We've been working in a tea shop all day! I'm sick of tea!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Sick of tea? That's like being sick of breathing!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd will spot you a mile away. You've got no manners!|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Excuse me? I've got no manners?! You're not exactly 'lady fancy fingers!'|Katara|Water|Water|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it. You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late.|Katara|Water|Water|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners be?|Aang|Air|All|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty. Your Momo-ness.|Aang|Air|All|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Avatar Aang, how do you do? Go on.|Sokka|Water|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys!|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Wow, you look beautiful.|Aang|Air|All|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society.|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over. Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless. How they wiped out all the people we loved.|Jet|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
The secret ingredient is love.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
It's beautiful, isn't it? By the way, I'm Long Feng. I'm a cultural minister to the king.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Look, I came up with a back-up plan. We dress Momo like a ghost, okay? He flies by the guards, creating a distraction. Then, we blast a hole in the wall-|Sokka|Water|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
I'd know your little footsteps anywhere, Twinkle Toes.|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
The Earth King has no time to get involved with political squabbles and the day to day minutia of military activities.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
What's most important to his royal majesty is maintaining the cultural heritage of Ba Sing Se. All his duties relate to issuing decrees on such matters. It's my job to oversee the rest of the city's resources, including the military.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Enough! I don't want to hear your ridiculous plan. It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that the War not be mentioned within the walls. Constant news of an escalating war will throw the citizens of Ba Sing Se into a state of panic.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia: the last one on Earth.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
I understand you've been looking for your bison. It would be quite a shame if you were not able to complete your quest.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Look! There's a coupon on the back! The first lesson is free.|Aang|Air|All|The Blind Bandit|Earth
So, are you ready to commit to more lessons? If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next belt!|Yu|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Oh ... a girl has her ways.|Katara|Water|Water|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.|Aang|Air|All|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Listen up, Hippo. You may be big, but you ain't bad!|The Boulder|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Yeah! Wooo! The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt!|Sokka|Water|None|The Blind Bandit|Earth
The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a young blind girl.|The Boulder|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Whenever you're ready, The Pebble!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Do people really want to see two little girls fighting out here?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Somebody's a little light on his feet! What's your fighting name: the Fancy Dancer?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
What are you doing here, Twinkle Toes?!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Don't answer to Twinkle Toes, it's not manly!|Sokka|Water|None|The Blind Bandit|Earth
What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar. And if he doesn't master earthbending soon, he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord.|Katara|Water|Water|The Blind Bandit|Earth
I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first.|Aang|Air|All|The Blind Bandit|Earth
Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing. I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I feel the vibrations in the Earth, and I can see where everything is.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
You think you're so tough? Why don't you come up here so I can snap that grin off your face?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
I love fighting. I love being an earthbender, and I'm really, really good at it.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Blind Bandit|Earth
You're going to be a great teacher, Toph.|Aang|Air|All|The Blind Bandit|Earth
That's not gross, it's just a part of spring! You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat.|Aang|Air|All|The Chase|Earth
I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group, because you two are disgusting.|Katara|Water|Water|The Chase|Earth
Excuse me, does anyone have a razor? Because I've got some hairy pits!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food and look,  my tent's all set up.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
Your powers of perception are frightening.|Sokka|Water|None|The Chase|Earth
Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
Look here, sugar queen, I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending. So don't you talk to me about being selfish!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
Okay, forget about setting up camp. I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.|Sokka|Water|None|The Chase|Earth
Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.|Sokka|Water|None|The Chase|Earth
What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail?|Katara|Water|Water|The Chase|Earth
Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky.|Katara|Water|Water|The Chase|Earth
Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly.|Aang|Air|All|The Chase|Earth
Okay, three on three plus Sokka.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
Well, we wanted to find out who they were and we found out. Now let's get out of here.|Sokka|Water|None|The Chase|Earth
The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary.|Katara|Water|Water|The Chase|Earth
Hey, I never asked you for diddly-doo-dah.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
Ow ... That really hurt my tailbone.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
Hmmm ... they're not wads, they're more like bundles, or bunches? It's got an 'uh' sound.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Chase|Earth
Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you.|Sokka|Water|None|The Chase|Earth
Was it just me, or was that guy kind of cute?|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Chase|Earth
You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint. I must find the Avatar to restore my honor! It's okay, you can laugh. It's funny.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me, but I can take care of myself, by myself.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
Not that I love you, I just met you.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
Oh, and about your nephew, maybe you should tell him that you need him, too.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Chase|Earth
I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors, all working together. I'm done. I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Chase|Earth
It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.|Sokka|Water|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
This coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, I will snuff it out.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Nice speech, Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
I thought you were going to make that one guy pee his pants.|Mai|Fire|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.  But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Have you met the Dai Li? They're earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that's so firebender. I just love it.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
You're so dramatic. What? Are you going to challenge me to an Agni Kai?|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. Then he gave me some tea and some very good advice.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.|Aang|Air|All|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!|Katara|Water|Water|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, no offense.|Sokka|Water|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!|Aang|Air|All|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, you will come to a better place.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
What are you in time for, cutie?|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.|Sokka|Water|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Oooh, it's like we're dancing together!|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Now comes the part where I double cross you. Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation princess!|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing, so you've had to struggle, and connive, and claw your way to power. But true power, the divine right to rule, is something you're born with.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
You've beaten me at my own game.|Long Feng|Earth|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Don't flatter yourself! You were never even a player.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
You're not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
I need you, Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day, this glorious day in Fire Nation history, and the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have Father's love. You will have everything you want.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Zuko, I am begging you. Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front paws instead of your rear ones.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
I betrayed Uncle.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
The Earth Kingdom ... has fallen.|Kuei|Earth|None|The Crossroads of Destiny|Earth
I can't believe it. I know the War has spread far, but Omashu always seemed ... untouchable.|Aang|Air|All|Return to Omashu|Earth
A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time?|Sokka|Water|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
Uh, he has pentapox, sir. Umm, it's highly contagious.|Katara|Water|Water|Return to Omashu|Earth
Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying|Sokka|Water|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
Thank you, sewer friends.|Aang|Air|All|Return to Omashu|Earth
The Royal Procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile, nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Return to Omashu|Earth
There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.|Mai|Fire|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
I thought my life was boring in the Fire Nation, but this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens.|Mai|Fire|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
Certainly our parents didn't send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up in ... places like this.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Return to Omashu|Earth
But the truth is, I'm really happy here. I mean, my aura has never been pinker!|Ty Lee|Fire|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
I'll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Return to Omashu|Earth
The day of the invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were prepared to defend our city ... to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before we even had a chance, King Bumi surrendered.|Yung|Earth|Earth|Return to Omashu|Earth
You don't understand. They've taken our home, and we have to fight them at any cost!|Yung|Earth|Earth|Return to Omashu|Earth
You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.|Sokka|Water|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
Okay everyone! Into sick formation.|Sokka|Water|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
Come on, Flopsie. You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh ... I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!|Aang|Air|All|Return to Omashu|Earth
The universe has given me strong hints that it's time for a career change. I want to join you on your mission.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
No! Bad Fire Nation baby!|Sokka|Water|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
Please tell me you're here to kill me.|Mai|Fire|None|Return to Omashu|Earth
We're trading a two year old for a king. A powerful, earthbending king?|Azula|Fire|Fire|Return to Omashu|Earth
There are options in fighting, called jing. It's a choice of how you direct your energy.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|Return to Omashu|Earth
Well, technically there are eighty-five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|Return to Omashu|Earth
Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking|Bumi|Earth|Earth|Return to Omashu|Earth
Choose well. A sky bison is a companion for life.|Iio|Air|Air|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
No sudden movements. He's been lost for a while and he looks like he's hurt. He's shy around people and scared. Stay low and stay quiet.|Suki|Earth|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
My, my, you're easy to find. It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
Who are you? The Avatar's fan girls?|Azula|Fire|Fire|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
Oh, I get it. Good one, Azula.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
No Avatar, huh. Well, that's okay. Any friend of the Avatar is an enemy of mine!|Azula|Fire|Fire|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous.|Mai|Fire|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
You're not prettier than we are.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
Afraid of fire, I see. That's good. You should be.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
Don't you know fans just make flames stronger?|Azula|Fire|Fire|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
I know I'm not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. The world is full of surprises.|Guru Pathik|None|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed. So twisted up inside. You're still full of love. Ah. But fear has moved in where trust should be.|Guru Pathik|None|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
Oh, your emotions are so turbulent. Like swirling storm clouds. Let the clouds in your mind be gentle, peaceful ones.|Guru Pathik|None|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
You and the Avatar's energies are mixed. You have an unbreakable bond. By reading your energy, I can sense where Aang is.|Guru Pathik|None|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
Funny, what invisible strings connect us all.|Guru Pathik|None|None|Appa's Lost Days|Earth
You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!|Aang|Air|All|The Desert|Earth
That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!|Aang|Air|All|The Desert|Earth
Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kahchi? I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Desert|Earth
Hmmm ... Old friends that don't want to attack me ...|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Desert|Earth
If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
We're drinking your bending water. You used this on the swamp guy! Urch!|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!|Katara|Water|Water|The Desert|Earth
Suit yourself. It's very thirst quenching though.|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. It's the quenchiest!|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
Who lit Toph on fire?|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
Can I get some of that cactus?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Desert|Earth
How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
It's a giant mushroom! Maybe it's friendly!|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Desert|Earth
Why don't we ask the circle birds?|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody, hold hands. We can do this. We have to.|Katara|Water|Water|The Desert|Earth
Momo, no! You've killed us all!|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
What?! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that? It was you! You ratted me out!|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
What are you old gasbags talking about?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Desert|Earth
I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Desert|Earth
Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Desert|Earth
Appa? But why would Princess Yue need him? She's the moon! She flies by herself!|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going! And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Desert|Earth
Now that you played Pai Sho, are you going to do some flower arranging, or is someone in this club going to offer some real help?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Desert|Earth
One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Desert|Earth
Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice.|Sokka|Water|None|The Desert|Earth
You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave?!|Katara|Water|Water|The Desert|Earth
We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn't break through to the city.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Desert|Earth
You muzzled Appa?|Aang|Air|All|The Desert|Earth
Maybe a chicken flew over.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
I'll take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you!|Lee|Earth|Earth|Zuko Alone|Earth
Anyone who can hold his own against those bully soldiers is welcome here. Those men should be ashamed to wear Earth Kingdom uniforms.|Gansu|Earth|Earth|Zuko Alone|Earth
That's what moms are like. If you mess with their babies, they're gonna bite you back!|Ursa|Fire|None|Zuko Alone|Earth
I am not cart-wheeling.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
We are brother and sister. It's important for us to spend time together! Don't you think so, Mom?|Azula|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
Girls are crazy!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than His Royal Tea-Loving Kookiness.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
Keep in mind, these are dual swords. Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of them as separate, 'cause they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good!|Azula|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
No, it means Uncle's a quitter and a loser.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
He found out his son died and he just fell apart! A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
Fire Lord Azulon ... can't you just call him 'Grandfather'? He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up taking his place soon.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
That's who you are, Zuko. Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard.|Ursa|Fire|None|Zuko Alone|Earth
I'm only telling you for your own good. I know! Maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you!|Azula|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
Azula always lies.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
It doesn't matter who I am. But I know who you are. You're not soldiers; you're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army – you're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are|Ursa|Fire|None|Zuko Alone|Earth
My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Prince of the Fire Nation, and heir to the throne.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Zuko Alone|Earth
I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is not something to fear.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Sorry, Sifu Hotman.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?|Sokka|Water|None|The Firebending Masters|Fire
I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.|Katara|Water|Water|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough.|Sokka|Water|None|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
They were blind, just like me. So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Firebending Masters|Fire
It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good?|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you. You're pretty smart.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me!|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Think about our place in the universe?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way, the original way.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sir, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet. Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
You can do it. I know you can. You're a talented kid.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you was my drive ... it was my purpose. So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive. I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.|Sokka|Water|None|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy!|Sokka|Water|None|The Awakening|Fire
I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long, over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how I've changed.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Awakening|Fire
I just asked if you were cold, I didn't ask for your whole life story.|Mai|Fire|None|The Awakening|Fire
I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was gone! But you brought me back.|Aang|Air|All|The Awakening|Fire
So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.|Sokka|Water|None|The Awakening|Fire
Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead! Isn't that great?|Sokka|Water|None|The Awakening|Fire
Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Awakening|Fire
Load the Toph!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Awakening|Fire
The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?|Sokka|Water|None|The Awakening|Fire
I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back.|Aang|Air|All|The Awakening|Fire
You've been away for a long time. I see the weight of your travels has changed you. You have redeemed yourself, my son. Welcome home.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|The Awakening|Fire
I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I'm so sad and angry and hurt!|Katara|Water|Water|The Awakening|Fire
I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day when I was gone and every night when I went to sleep, I would lie awake missing you so much it would ache.|Hakoda|Water|None|The Awakening|Fire
If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I should have seen this war coming and prevented it. You inherited my problems and my mistakes. But I believe you are destined to redeem me and save the world.|Roku|Fire|All|The Awakening|Fire
You're right. I won't give up.|Aang|Air|All|The Awakening|Fire
Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut.|Sokka|Water|None|The Headband|Fire
Hey, we're in enemy territory. Those are enemy birds.|Sokka|Water|None|The Headband|Fire
Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.|Katara|Water|Water|The Headband|Fire
Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Headband|Fire
Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes.|Sokka|Water|None|The Headband|Fire
I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, 'stay flamin'.|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
Greetings, my good hotman.|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat.|Sokka|Water|None|The Headband|Fire
Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you 'Mannerless Colony Slob'?|Kwan|Fire|None|The Headband|Fire
Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible.|Sokka|Water|None|The Headband|Fire
Flamey-O, Hotman!|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist.|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah.|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce! Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!|Sokka|Water|None|The Headband|Fire
You're so beautiful when you hate the world.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Headband|Fire
What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?|Sokka|Water|None|The Headband|Fire
Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork!|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Headband|Fire
Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now.|Aang|Air|All|The Headband|Fire
We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache, now.|Katara|Water|Water|The Headband|Fire
You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?|Sokka|Water|None|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Uhhh ... I think your feet need their eyes checked.|Katara|Water|Water|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.|Sokka|Water|None|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Hello ... Zuko here|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm considered to be pretty good at it.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
What would Uncle do? Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
What would Azula do? Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Right. Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
I've done some good things! I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. That's something!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!|Sokka|Water|None|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.|Sokka|Water|None|The Western Air Temple|Fire
You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The 'not as much of a jerk as you could have been' award!|Katara|Water|Water|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Ergh! I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one around here!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Uggh! Why am I so bad at being good?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally!|Sokka|Water|None|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it!|Sokka|Water|None|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Not being able to see with your feet stinks.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Western Air Temple|Fire
I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me.|Aang|Air|All|The Western Air Temple|Fire
So, here you go, home sweet home, I guess, you know, for now. Unpack? Lunch, soon? Uhhh ... welcome aboard?|Sokka|Water|None|The Western Air Temple|Fire
You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Western Air Temple|Fire
So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently.|Katara|Water|Water|The Western Air Temple|Fire
Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.|Aang|Air|All|The Runaway|Fire
I'll give you a mud pie!|Katara|Water|Water|The Runaway|Fire
I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Runaway|Fire
Hey! I only cheated because he was cheating! I cheated a cheater. What's wrong with that?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Runaway|Fire
Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Runaway|Fire
Speaking of that 'third-eyed freak', I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of 'Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man'?|Sokka|Water|None|The Runaway|Fire
Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting.|Sokka|Water|None|The Runaway|Fire
Hawky! Make nice! Bad Hawky!|Sokka|Water|None|The Runaway|Fire
I know this is from you, Sokka! Toph can't write!|Katara|Water|Water|The Runaway|Fire
I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.|Aang|Air|All|The Runaway|Fire
When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.|Sokka|Water|None|The Runaway|Fire
I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.|Sokka|Water|None|The Runaway|Fire
The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. Don't ever tell her I said any of this!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Runaway|Fire
Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you.|Katara|Water|Water|The Runaway|Fire
Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Runaway|Fire
Katara! You're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Runaway|Fire
This guy is too good! He shoots fire from his brain!|Sokka|Water|None|The Runaway|Fire
Hey, I got it! The perfect name for that guy: 'Combustion Man!'|Sokka|Water|None|The Runaway|Fire
Top of the morning, Momo!|Aang|Air|All|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
You know what I just heard? Blah, blah, spiritual mumbo jumbo blah, blah, something about space.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf-hat?|Hakoda|Water|None|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Pants are an illusion, and so is death.|Huu|Water|Water|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Negatory. The Boulder and The Hippo no longer fight for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our kingdom!|The Boulder|Earth|Earth|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Yes, but unfortunately the incendiary capabilities of peanut sauce prove to be a failure.|Mechanist|Earth|None|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that.|Aang|Air|All|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.|Aang|Air|All|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Yeah, congratulations, Sokka. You managed to invent a worse way of travel than flying.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, Twinkle Toes.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.|Katara|Water|Water|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
Where in tarnation is Huu?|Tho|Water|Water|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.|Katara|Water|Water|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too.|Katara|Water|Water|The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion|Fire
It's going to be great to hang out on the beach and do nothing.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Beach|Fire
It smells like old lady in here.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
Aang, I know swimming is fun and all, but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Beach|Fire
See that girl with the silly pigtails? When she runs toward the ball, there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot. I'm willing to bet a childhood injury has weakened her. Keep serving the ball to her left, and we'll destroy her and the rest of her team.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
Yes! We defeated you for all time! You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation!|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
I'm so used to people worshiping us.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
That's a sharp outfit, Chan. Careful. You could puncture the hull of an empire-class Fire Nation battleship, leaving thousands to drown at sea, because it's so sharp.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
Oh, I'm glad you're here. Those boys won't leave me alone. I guess they all just like me too much.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Beach|Fire
Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
What? You're jealous of me? But you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Beach|Fire
Together, you and I will be the strongest couple in the entire world! We will dominate the Earth!|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
Your temper is out of control. You blow up over every little thing. You're so impatient and hotheaded and angry!|Mai|Fire|None|The Beach|Fire
This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?|Sokka|Water|None|The Beach|Fire
I joined the circus because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set. At least I'm different now. 'Circus freak' is a compliment.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Beach|Fire
What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't. I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted ... as long as I behaved and sat still, and didn't speak unless spoken to.|Mai|Fire|None|The Beach|Fire
Calm down, you guys. This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Beach|Fire
Bad skin? Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now, my dad talks to me. Ha! He even thinks I'm a hero. Everything should be perfect, right? I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. My own mother thought I was a monster. She was right, of course, but it still hurt.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Beach|Fire
You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut.|Hakoda|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
All I get is a letter? You could have least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.|Mai|Fire|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
Because I'm a people person.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
I don't need any protection.|Mai|Fire|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
Sorry, warden. You're my prisoner now.|Suki|Earth|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
Saving the jerk who dumped me.|Mai|Fire|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you.|Mai|Fire|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more!|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
Seriously? You guys didn't find any meat?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Boiling Rock, Part 2|Fire
You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh!|Sokka|Water|None|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, but I just don't know if I can do that.|Aang|Air|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint, but it backfired when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy. If I had been more decisive and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin and stopped the war before it started. I offer you this wisdom, Aang: You must be decisive.|Roku|Fire|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
How about Grand-Pakku?|Sokka|Water|None|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
All old people know each other. Don't you know that?|Bumi|Earth|Earth|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire

Personally, I don't really see the difference, but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to stop Chin. I offer you this wisdom, Aang: Only justice will bring peace.|Kyoshi|Earth|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.|Aang|Air|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Aang, you must actively shape your own destiny and the destiny of the world.|Kuruk|Water|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Well, here we are. Welcome to Old People Camp.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
No, I'm not okay. My uncle hates me, I know it. He loved and supported me in every way he could, and I still turned against him. How can I even face him?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Avatar Aang, I know that you're a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well, but this isn't about you. This is about the world.|Yangchen|Air|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Many great and wise Air Nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment, but the Avatar can never do it. Because your sole duty is to the world. Here is my wisdom for you: Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world.|Yangchen|Air|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. I have to kill the Fire Lord.|Aang|Air|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you had lost your way.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war. History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
You've struggled; you've suffered, but you have always followed your own path. You restored your own honor, and only you can restore the honor of the Fire Nation.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Sozin's Comet is arriving, and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord. When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se. Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation, so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Nothing runs faster over land or swims quicker than a giant eel hound.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Goodbye, everyone. Today, destiny is our friend. I know it.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed. Since beginningless time, darkness thrives in the void but always yields to purifying light.|Lion Turtle|None|None|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
It's time for this world to end in fire, and for a new world to be born from the ashes.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters|Fire
Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook! Get it? Like a fishing hook?|Sokka|Water|None|The Painted Lady|Fire
Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today.|Sokka|Water|None|The Painted Lady|Fire
Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy!|Aang|Air|All|The Painted Lady|Fire
These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them? How can you be so cold and heartless?|Katara|Water|Water|The Painted Lady|Fire
Finagle away, oh schedule master.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Painted Lady|Fire
I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.|Sokka|Water|None|The Painted Lady|Fire
And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.|Sokka|Water|None|The Painted Lady|Fire
I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends!|Aang|Air|All|The Painted Lady|Fire
You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive.|Aang|Air|All|The Painted Lady|Fire
You wanna destroy this factory?|Aang|Air|All|The Painted Lady|Fire
I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises!|Sokka|Water|None|The Painted Lady|Fire
No, I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me!|Katara|Water|Water|The Painted Lady|Fire
You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself.|Katara|Water|Water|The Painted Lady|Fire

I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation. And I will. The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided.

From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy everything; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which all the lands are Fire Nation and I am the supreme ruler of everything!|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire
My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there. I'd forgotten who I was.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire
I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire

Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire
No, I agree with you. Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way.|Aang|Air|All|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire
Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire

Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you?|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire
Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world. From this moment on, I will be known as ... the Phoenix King.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King|Fire
Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Puppetmaster|Fire
Wait! Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain. And they're screaming.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Puppetmaster|Fire
You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man?|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!|Sokka|Water|None|The Puppetmaster|Fire
I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone.|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.|Katara|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air?|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!|Sokka|Water|None|The Puppetmaster|Fire
They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak.|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
Bloodbending. Controlling the water in another body, enforcing your own will over theirs.|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
We have to fight these people whenever we can, wherever they are, with any means necessary!|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
My work is done. Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.|Hama|Water|Water|The Puppetmaster|Fire
I'm never happy.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea, it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. It's my mistake, and it's my job to fix it. I have to regain my honor.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
'Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko.' One more thing. 'Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko.'|Katara|Water|Water|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
Nobody else has homework. One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ...|Aang|Air|All|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
My first girlfriend turned into the moon.|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
That's rough, buddy.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
Prisoners! Am I right?|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
Ah, what would Uncle say? Sometimes, clouds have two sides, a dark and light, and a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich! So ... when life seems hard ... take a bite out of the silver sandwich!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
That's the spirit! I can't believe that worked. I didn't even know what I was saying.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
I'm so glad to see you Sokka. I knew you'd come.|Suki|Earth|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?|Sokka|Water|None|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Boiling Rock, Part 1|Fire
Really? How do you plan on doing that when you're not even wearing pants?|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down!|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
So it seems, but are you prepared for your ... mathematics test?|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test!|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
But I forgot my pants and my math test.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Wake up, Aang. Wake up, sleepy head! Rise and shine! You overslept. You missed the invasion.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast!|Sokka|Water|None|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom! We died because of your tiny bladder.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Want to try screaming into this pillow?|Sokka|Water|None|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
You know what will make you feel better? Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time.|Mai|Fire|None|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this. I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. I'm doing it for you, Katara.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
I'm saying, I love you!|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Baby, you're my forever girl.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison.|Sokka|Water|None|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Boy, you are really starting to lose it, kid.|Momo|Air|None|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
No, but I said something. You, my friend, are just a few plums short of a fruit pie.|Momo|Air|None|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
No! I am sick of this guy always mouthing me and telling me what to do!|Appa|Air|Air|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras. Chakras, chakras, chakras sandwich tastes good. Yum!|Guru Pathik|None|None|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
No, Fire Lord Ozai. You're not wearing any pants.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
No! My royal parts are showing.|Aang|Air|All|Nightmares and Daydreams|Fire
It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. Make sure he gets your good side.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Love is hard when you are young.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World?|Katara|Water|Water|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Some friendships are so strong, they can even transcend lifetimes.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
When love is real, it finds a way. And being the Avatar doesn't hurt your chances with the ladies, either.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
I'm sparing you, Sozin. I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship. But I warn you. Even a single step out of line will result in your permanent end.|Roku|Fire|All|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore balance to the world.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance.|Aang|Air|All|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Avatar and The Fire Lord|Fire
Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.|Sokka|Water|None|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
There's no floor. It's just a river of lava.|Sokka|Water|None|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last!|Ozai|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
You mean I'm not good enough for you? You're hurting my feelings.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn. My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai. How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it! We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
I'll roll your whole head!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness. He's the one who's been a real father to me.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse|Fire
I'm worried about Aang. What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my father? What if he loses?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Yes, it is. So, please. Tell me why, on the most important day of my life, you've decided to leave a pit in my cherry?|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
What are you all looking at? I have two feet that need scrubbing. And make sure you get in between the toes. I won't have my first day as Fire Lord marred by poor foot hygiene.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
It's weird to say, but the comet actually looks beautiful.|Suki|Earth|None|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Five, to be precise, in which time an assassin could've snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way!|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
That's a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the giant airship!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Attention, crew, this is your captain speaking. Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream. We have a very special birthday to celebrate.|Sokka|Water|None|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later, they all would have betrayed me. Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here.|Bumi|Earth|Earth|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me. You think I'm a monster.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Well what choice do I have?! Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way. Even you fear me.|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
After generations of Fire Lords failed to find you, now the universe delivers you to me as an act of providence.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Go, Aang! Airbending slice!|Sokka|Water|None|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
Wait. You want to be Fire Lord? Fine. Let's settle this. Just you and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai!|Azula|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
There's something off about her; I can't explain it but she's slipping. And this way, no one else has to get hurt.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
No lightning today? What's the matter?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
You're weak, just like the rest of your people! They did not deserve to exist in this world ... in my world! Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!|Ozai|Fire|Fire|Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno|Fire
So what, I'm just a lemur sitter?|Sokka|Water|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night.|Aang|Air|All|Sokka's Master|Fire
Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is that we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Sokka's Master|Fire
What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.|Katara|Water|Water|Sokka's Master|Fire
It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, okay? I can't do anything.|Sokka|Water|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
I mean, look at Katara's hair, right? What's up with that?|Aang|Air|All|Sokka's Master|Fire
The first thing you must learn is that your weapon is an extension of yourself. You must think of it as another part of your own body.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
Well, more like an extra-long, really sharp arm.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
The sword is a simple tool, but in the hands of a master it becomes the most versatile of weapons, and just as the imagination is limitless, so too are the possibilities of the sword.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
I'm tapped out. I already picked my toes, twice.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Sokka's Master|Fire
I-It's so hot, it's so hot ... Momo is shedding like Appa. Huh, huh?|Katara|Water|Water|Sokka's Master|Fire
The warrior practices a variety of arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
Remember, you cannot take back a stroke of the brush, or a stroke of the sword.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
Landscape painting teaches a warrior to hold the lay of the land in his mind.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
Rock gardening teaches the warrior to manipulate his surroundings and use them to his advantage.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Sokka's Master|Fire
Ooh, I got one: if you miss him so much, why don't you marry him?|Katara|Water|Water|Sokka's Master|Fire
Choosing the correct material is the most important step in crafting a sword. You must trust your steel with your life.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
You told me you didn't know if you were worthy, but I believe that you are more worthy than any man I have ever trained.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
I think I'm a little old to be fighting the Avatar.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
The way of the sword doesn't belong to any one nation.|Piandao|Fire|None|Sokka's Master|Fire
You know, I don't think there's such a thing as 'space earth'. If it's from space, then it's not really 'earth'.|Katara|Water|Water|Sokka's Master|Fire
Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now!|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
You mean it's not obvious yet? I am about to celebrate becoming an only child!|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you! Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different?|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Then you didn't love her the way I did!|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him.|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it! Why don't you take a closer look?|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty.|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Then I have a question for you. What are you gonna do when you face my father?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Ugh! My mother used to take us to see them. They butchered Love Amongst the Dragons every year!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Ember Island Players|Fire
Come on, a day at the theater? This is the kind of wacky time-wasting nonsense I've been missing!|Sokka|Water|None|The Ember Island Players|Fire
Why are we sitting in the nosebleed section? My feet can't see a thing from up here!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Ember Island Players|Fire
Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.|Katara|Water|Water|The Ember Island Players|Fire
I think he's got you pegged!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Ember Island Players|Fire
They make me look totally stiff and humorless.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Ember Island Players|Fire
You never told me you made out with a Moon Spirit.|Suki|Earth|None|The Ember Island Players|Fire
I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Ember Island Players|Fire
Relax, Aang. They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.|Katara|Water|Water|The Ember Island Players|Fire
Did Jet just ... die?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Ember Island Players|Fire
It seems like every time there's a big battle, you guys barely make it out alive. I mean, you guys lose a lot!|Suki|Earth|None|The Ember Island Players|Fire
I'm an elite warrior who's trained for many years in the art of stealth. I think I could get you backstage!|Suki|Earth|None|The Ember Island Players|Fire
All your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path, and see the light. Now you're here with us. He'd be proud.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Ember Island Players|Fire
I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be.|Sokka|Water|None|The Ember Island Players|Fire
