You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it?|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
Food eats people! Also, Momo could talk. You said some very unkind things.|Sokka|Water|None|The Storm|Water
Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?|Merchant woman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?|Sokka|Water|None|The Storm|Water
You could get a job, smart guy.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.|Fisherman's wife|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Well, it's your joints against my brain.|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'.|Fisherman's wife|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?|Jee|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!|Fisherman's wife|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Boy with tattoos? Airbender tattoos. Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle. You're the Avatar, ain't ya?|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world!|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering.|Fisherman|Earth|None|The Storm|Water
Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives.|Tashi|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.|Pasang|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
I'm sick of taking his orders! I'm tired of chasing his Avatar! I mean, who does Zuko think he is?|Jee|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Try to understand. My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.|Gyatso|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. Zuko would have to duel his own father.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.|Gyatso|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.|Pasang|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?|Gyatso|Air|Air|The Storm|Water
And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.|Katara|Water|Water|The Storm|Water
When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Please, Father. I only had the Fire Nation's best interest at heart. I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
You will fight for your honor.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
I meant you no disrespect. I am your loyal son.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
You will learn respect, and suffering will be your teacher.|Ozai|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Storm|Water
I'm too young to die!|Sokka|Water|None|The Storm|Water
I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it.|Aang|Air|All|The Storm|Water
