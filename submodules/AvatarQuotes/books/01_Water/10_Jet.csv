I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior, so I'm the leader!|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water

How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?|Sokka|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother, we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.|Jet|Earth|None|Jet|Water
Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me, you're sick and I trusted you!|Katara|Water|Water|Jet|Water
