Those clouds look so soft, don't they? Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft, cottony heap?|Katara|Water|Water|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Turns out, clouds are made of water.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick!|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
What? I'm not allowed to be angry?|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.|Katara|Water|Water|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible! But, those markings ... are you the Avatar, child?|Kay-fon|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
So, the rumors of your return are true! It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.|Senlin Village leader|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope! For the last few days at sunset, a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is Hei Bai, the black and white spirit.|Kay-fon|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Hei Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here, there's no telling what will happen.|Senlin Village leader|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the Spirit World than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits.|Kay-fon|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Yeah. We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West. The once-great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.|Earthbender captain|Earth|Earth|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
The Avatar's methods are ... unusual.|Senlin Village leader|Earth|None|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.|Earthbender captain|Earth|Earth|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. And I'm still tired.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
I'm in the Spirit World!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
Now would you please put on some clothes?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World|Water
