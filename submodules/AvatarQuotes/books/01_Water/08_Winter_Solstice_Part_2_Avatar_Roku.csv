Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.|Katara|Water|Water|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today!|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
I'm chasing the Avatar! My father will understand why I am returning home!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!|Katara|Water|Water|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Can't you make Appa go any faster?|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Let's run this blockade!|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
The Avatar. And the banished prince. This must be my lucky day.|Zhao|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
You did it buddy. Nice flying.|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water

We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.|Great Fire Sage|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become! Split up and find him.|Great Fire Sage|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Firebenders aren't our friends!|Shyu|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this Fire Temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.|Shyu|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Things have changed. In the past, the sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.|Shyu|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late!|Sokka|Water|None|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.|Katara|Water|Water|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Sokka, you're a genius!|Katara|Water|Water|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years?|Aang|Air|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
It's good to see you Aang. What took you so long?|Roku|Fire|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water

Sozin's Comet will return by the end of this summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all. If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang. You must defeat the Fire Lord, before the comet arrives.|Roku|Fire|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end.|Roku|Fire|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
I know you can do it Aang. For you have done it before.|Roku|Fire|All|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
No Prince, no Avatar! Apparently, the only thing I do have is five traitors!|Zhao|Fire|Fire|Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku|Water
