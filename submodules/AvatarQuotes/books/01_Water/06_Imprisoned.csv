Quote|Character|Nation|Bending|Episode|Book
We've got a few options. First; round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might just be rocks.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Shouldn't we run away from huge booms? Not toward them?|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Which means no nuts for dinner!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Yeah, I hate 'em too.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Great hat! I'll trade you some nuts for it.|Aang|Air|All|Imprisoned|Water
They're crazy, Mom! I mean, look at how they're dressed.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Fire Nation! Act natural!|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
They're thugs. They steal from us. And everyone here's too much of a coward to do anything about it.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Yeah. Problem is ... the only way I can feel close to my father now is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and ta-da! Fake earthbending.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
Get out of my way, pipsqueak!|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
That lemur! He's earthbending!|Guard|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
Momo, you have some big ears!|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing.|Sokka|Water|None|Imprisoned|Water
You've got guts, Katara. I'll give you that.|Haru|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Katara, I admire your courage. And I envy your youth. But people's lives are at stake here. The warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless.|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your courage they should truly fear!|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up on these people.|Katara|Water|Water|Imprisoned|Water
Well, sir, it looked like a flying bison.|Captain|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
It was a giant flying buffalo, sir. With an empty saddle.|Guard|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
Then wake up someone I haven't thrown overboard and search the rig! There's something going on here and I don't like it.|Warden|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
wish I knew how to make a hurricane!|Aang|Air|All|Imprisoned|Water
Foolish girl. You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces. Their spirits were broken a long time ago.|Warden|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
No, please! I can't swim!|Warden|Fire|Fire|Imprisoned|Water
Don't worry. I hear cowards float.|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!|Tyro|Earth|Earth|Imprisoned|Water
