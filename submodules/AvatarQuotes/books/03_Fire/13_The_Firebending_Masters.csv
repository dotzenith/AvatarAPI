I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is not something to fear.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Sorry, Sifu Hotman.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?|Sokka|Water|None|The Firebending Masters|Fire
I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.|Katara|Water|Water|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough.|Sokka|Water|None|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
They were blind, just like me. So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Firebending Masters|Fire
It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good?|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you. You're pretty smart.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me!|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Think about our place in the universe?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way, the original way.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sir, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet. Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
You can do it. I know you can. You're a talented kid.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life.|Aang|Air|All|The Firebending Masters|Fire
That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you was my drive ... it was my purpose. So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive. I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Firebending Masters|Fire
We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.|Sokka|Water|None|The Firebending Masters|Fire
