Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now!|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
You mean it's not obvious yet? I am about to celebrate becoming an only child!|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you! Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different?|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Then you didn't love her the way I did!|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him.|Aang|Air|All|The Southern Raiders|Fire
You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.|Sokka|Water|None|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it! Why don't you take a closer look?|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty.|Katara|Water|Water|The Southern Raiders|Fire
Then I have a question for you. What are you gonna do when you face my father?|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Southern Raiders|Fire
