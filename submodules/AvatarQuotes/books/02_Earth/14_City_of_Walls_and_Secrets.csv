Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!|Sokka|Water|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
You been hitting the cactus juice again?|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth

Hello, my name is Joo Dee! I have been given the great honor of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se. And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph! Welcome to our wonderful city. Shall we get started?|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here.|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
This city is a prison. I don't want to make a life here.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Blech! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se. They are the guardians of all our traditions!|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
The Earth King is very busy running the finest city in the world!|Joo Dee|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth

Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd will spot you a mile away. You've got no manners!|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Excuse me? I've got no manners?! You're not exactly 'lady fancy fingers!'|Katara|Water|Water|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it. You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late.|Katara|Water|Water|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth

Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty. Your Momo-ness.|Aang|Air|All|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Avatar Aang, how do you do? Go on.|Sokka|Water|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys!|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Wow, you look beautiful.|Aang|Air|All|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society.|Toph|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over. Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless. How they wiped out all the people we loved.|Jet|Earth|None|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
The secret ingredient is love.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth

What's most important to his royal majesty is maintaining the cultural heritage of Ba Sing Se. All his duties relate to issuing decrees on such matters. It's my job to oversee the rest of the city's resources, including the military.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
Enough! I don't want to hear your ridiculous plan. It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that the War not be mentioned within the walls. Constant news of an escalating war will throw the citizens of Ba Sing Se into a state of panic.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia: the last one on Earth.|Long Feng|Earth|Earth|City of Walls and Secrets|Earth
