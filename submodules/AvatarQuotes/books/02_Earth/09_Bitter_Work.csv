Goooood morning, earthbending student!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara.|Katara|Water|Water|Bitter Work|Earth
Sorry, Snoozles, we'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Oh, maybe I could learn to make a whirlpool out of land!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp!|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
You must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Fire is the element of power. he people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay?|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal?|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
f you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
Earthbend, Twinkle Toes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast. And even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got stuff.|Toph|Earth|Earth|Bitter Work|Earth
Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important.|Sokka|Water|None|Bitter Work|Earth
Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!|Aang|Air|All|Bitter Work|Earth
You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back! Come on, strike me! You've never held back before!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|Bitter Work|Earth
