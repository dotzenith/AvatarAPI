Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Deadly route. Great pick, Sokka!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... as a tourist!|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Look around. We're not tourists, we're refugees. Ugh! I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt. I'm tired of living like this!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Ahhh! My cabbages!|Cabbage merchant|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
It is your pleasure. As you can see, I am blind and these three imbeciles are my valets.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.|Suki|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Suki!|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since.|Suki|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
No passports, no tickets!|Ticket lady|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order! You know what that means, no more civilization!|Ticket lady|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.|Suki|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
How can we abandon hope? It's all we have!|Ying|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it.|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
"Thanks for saving my life, Toph." Hey, no problem, Sokka.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
You know, it's okay to miss Appa. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all.|Katara|Water|Water|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.|Katara|Water|Water|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Maybe it's because I'm not a man ... I'm a girl!|Smellerbee|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I know, you're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks, Longshot.|Smellerbee|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of, but that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se: for a new beginning. A second chance.|jet|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Actually, I'm going to stay on my little island, where I can see!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Oh Sokka, you saved me!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Oh ... well ... you can go ahead and let me drown now.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something?|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing!|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were. You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs. Because no one else will.|Jet|Earth|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
It's so ... squishy looking.|Sokka|Water|None|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.|Aang|Air|All|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
Say hi to that big fuzzball for me.|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Serpent's Pass|Earth
