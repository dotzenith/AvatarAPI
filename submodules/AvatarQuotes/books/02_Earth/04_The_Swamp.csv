They will if you ask nicely. Spare change for a hungry old man?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Swamp|Earth

I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me.|Aang|Air|All|The Swamp|Earth
No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ... alive.|Katara|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth

I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it, like this fella with his big knife.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth
Oh the swamp is a mystical place all right. It's sacred. I reached enlightenment right here under the banyan-grove tree.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth

You think you're any different from me or your friends or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together. You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots and we are all branches of the same tree.|Huu|Water|Water|The Swamp|Earth

I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!|Sokka|Water|None|The Swamp|Earth
