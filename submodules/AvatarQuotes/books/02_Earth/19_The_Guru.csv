It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. Things are looking up, Uncle.|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited?|Kuei|Earth|None|The Guru|Earth
It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth

In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth

Destructive? Buoyant? And ... Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!|Sokka|Water|None|The Guru|Earth

Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop?|Iroh|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth

Now let's make these people some tea!|Zuko|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles?|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this.|Mai|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes.|Ty Lee|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm going to throw up.|Mai|Fire|None|The Guru|Earth
You have indeed felt a great loss. But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love.|Guru Pathik|None|None|The Guru|Earth
Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth

So, Zuzu's in the city, too? I think it's time for a family reunion.|Azula|Fire|Fire|The Guru|Earth
I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.|Aang|Air|All|The Guru|Earth
I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!|Toph|Earth|Earth|The Guru|Earth
Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior.|Hakoda|Water|None|The Guru|Earth
